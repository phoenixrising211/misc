Just a dump of a few games and randomizers I created in my free time.

## TCG Pack Generator
Small Python application that procedurally generates a pack of fake Magic: the Gathering cards.

## Z
A relatively old Java RPG engine playable through the console with text inputs. Kinda clunky to play, but became the basis for "ZG/epic" below.

## ZG
A handful of lightweight prototype browser games I wrote in Javascript.
- arpg: A run-and-gun kind of shooter
- epic: A turn-based RPG adapted from the Java-based "Z" RPG above
- mv: A Metroidvania-style platformer
- wm: An idle/clicker game that goes pretty deep
